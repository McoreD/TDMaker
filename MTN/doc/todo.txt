i dont know how to do most of the things here. if you can help, please do!! :)
http://moviethumbnail.sourceforge.net/

bugs:
=====
- seeking in some files doesn't give a key frame. this slows down mtn a lot.
- how to make text align right?
- pts calculation might be incorrect
- is byte seeking working correctly?
- guess duration when unknown; or when duration is unknown, we'll switch unit
  from seconds to bytes
- fix static string buffers
- fix potential buffer overflow in string handling

future plans:
=============
- edge detection doesn't work very well. need a new convolution kernel?
- use multiple threads
- make mtn work with dvds -- both real ones and image files
- make mtn work with blue-ray & hd-dvd
- GUI! wxWidgets?
